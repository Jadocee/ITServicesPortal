# IT Services Portal

The IT Services Portal is a web application for managing and reporting IT services-related issues and incidents. It was created as part of a course assignment at the University of Newcastle, with the goal of improving the efficiency of the IT staff by providing a knowledge-base for users to browse before submitting an issue. The application was created using Spring Framework and Java, and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

## Use Cases

The IT Services Portal has different use cases depending on whether the user is an IT Staff member or a Client. The following are the use cases for each role:

### IT Staff

* Mark comments as suggested solutions
* Add or remove issues to the knowledge base
* View all issues
* Filter issues by status
* Tag issues

### Client

* Create issue reports
* View self-reported issues
* Review suggested solutions

### Both

* Comment on issues
* View the knowledge base
* Log in and out

## Features

The homepage of the application also includes a statistics section that shows the total unsolved incidents in each category, the total resolved incidents within the last 7 days in each category, and the stress rate.

This diagram shows that Clients can create issue reports and view their own self-reported issues. They can also review suggested solutions and comment on issues.

## Dependencies

To build and run the application, you will need the following dependencies:

* Apache Maven
* Java 11
* Local or cloud hosted Microsoft SQL (or T-SQL) database

## Setup

The IT Services Portal uses Spring Security to manage authentication, and data is stored on a SQL database accessed using JDBC. A SQL script for setting up the database is provided in the repository.

To run the application locally using Apache Tomcat (see [Tomcat Setup](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/setup.html)), follow these steps:

1. Move the project file into the `<tomcat-installation-directory>/webapps` directory
2. Run `<tomcat-installation-directory>/bin/startup.bat`
